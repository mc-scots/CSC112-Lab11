## Introduction
In this lab, you will be exploring other programming languages.  Form
up in a group of 2-3 students (or work on your own if you're the
antisocial type) and we'll dive in!  

## Language Selection
There are quite a few languages on our list.  These are:

  x86 assembly (as)
  python
  perl
  C# (csharp)
  lolcode (lci)
  common lisp (clisp)
  erlang (erlc,erl)
  snobol (snobol4)
  java (javac)
  Shakespeare programming language (spl2c)
  scheme
  fortran (gfortran)
  ada (gnat)
  Brainf--k (bf)
  php
  BASIC (bwbasic)
  prolog (gprolog)
  forth (gforth)
  algol 68 (a68g)
  chicken
  nodejs
  coffee
  R
  go
  rust (rustc)
  ruby
  awk
  guile

This is by no means a comprehensive list of languages, but it is
a list of most of the ones installed on the cs.maryvillecollege.edu
server.  The 10 most popular languages are on the list, as well as
some languages that were created purely for the fun of it.  (These
esoteric languages can be fun, in limited doses.)

You and your partner(s) will be randomly assigned a language in class.  


## Learn Your Language
Your task is to learn a little about your language. Use google and/or
wikipedia to do this.  You don't have to master the language, but you
should at least try to learn:

1. A bit of the history of your language.  Who created it? Why?
2. What is the paradigm of your language?
3. What are the basic control structures (branches, loops, function
   calls, etc.) in your language?
4. What sort of standard library does it come with?

## Code in Your Language
After you read up on it a little bit, your goals are as follows.  You
will write 4 programs, which you will turn in via github.  These
programs are:

1. A hello world program.
2. A program that counts from 1 to 10
3. A program that asks for a starting point, an ending point, and an
   increment and counts accordingly  For instance, consider the
   following:

   Start? 1
   Stop? 10
   Count By? 2
   1
   3
   5
   7
   9

4. Your choice of one of the lab or programming assignments from
   CSC111 http://cs.maryvillecollege.edu/Intro_CS_I

## Share your Language
In class on Thursday, we will have everyone give a little
presentation on your language.  Just a little 5 minute discussion
about how your language and show us the code you wrote.  Nothing too
formal, just a little discussion of your language among friends.
